<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<img src="../assets/images/me.jpg" alt="selfie" height="200">
<p>At both my previous and current workplaces, I was accepted as a team member, but within a short time, 
  I was also entrusted with coordination and management tasks. During my professional studies (11 years), 
  I was involved in the building and maintenance of computers, as well as web design. 
  I primarily worked with the Macromedia Flash 8 program, but I also learned the basics of HTML coding 
  by self taught. I also perform the system administrator tasks at my workplace. 
  I've been interested in nature and gardening since my childhood, but after 13 years of professional experience, 
  I feel the time has come for a career change to focus on my other passion.</p>
